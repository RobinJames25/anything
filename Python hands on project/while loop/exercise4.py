# Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure 
# the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add code 
# near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has 
# run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all occurrences of 
# 'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up 
# in finished_sandwiches.
